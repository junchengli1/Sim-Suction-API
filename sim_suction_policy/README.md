## Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

### Install with Docker

Open one terminal:

```
make build-image
```

```
make run
```

That's it.

If you would like to allow visualization across docker container, open another terminal and type:

```
xhost +
```


### Install without Docker
You should set the environment variable manually as follows if you want to build a local GPU environment for Grounded-SAM:
```bash
export AM_I_DOCKER=False
export BUILD_WITH_CUDA=True
export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda-11.3/
```

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
```


```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install) and [install OSX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX)
